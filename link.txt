🧠 Project Goal:

Use unsupervised learning techniques to identify potential fraudulent credit card transactions without labeled data.

📦 Dataset:

Credit Card Fraud Detection – Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud





284,807 transactions



Features are anonymized PCA components (V1 to V28) + Amount, Time



Label column is available but should be hidden from the model during unsupervised training (used only for evaluation).



🛠️ Project Steps:





Data Exploration





Understand distributions of Amount, Time



Check for imbalances or patterns



Preprocessing





Scale numerical values (e.g., MinMaxScaler)



Optional: Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE or PCA for visualization)



Unsupervised Techniques





Use Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM for anomaly detection



Compare results with Autoencoders (optional for more advanced students)



Evaluation





Reveal the hidden Class labels and evaluate precision, recall, F1-score



Focus on how well the model detects rare fraud cases (very imbalanced!)



Insights





Which types of transactions were flagged?



What patterns (if any) exist in detected anomalies?



📌 Learning Outcomes:





Understand how unsupervised models can detect rare events



Practice real-world anomaly detection in imbalanced datasets



Learn to validate unsupervised results using available labels
